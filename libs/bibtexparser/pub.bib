ABSTRACT="The challenge of bringing more intelligence to the infrastructure of modern
cities requires a change of thinking and states a demand for new algorithms
and strategies. One important outcome of those algorithms is a realtime
estimation of the prevalent spatio-temporal conditions of public
transportation networks by making use of distributed image processing on
networked smart camera systems. This paper provides a detailed analysis of
two exemplary networked applications that can use the derived data. A
conducted simulation study based on the infrastructure of real cities shows
the potential of using autonomously generated knowledge, that smart camera
systems can provide. Especially, inter-camera object tracking, as well as
adaptive and smart navigation tasks can benefit considerably and
substantiate the need for autonomous and confidential image processing."
